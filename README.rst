BUGS
====

A python parser for BUGS statistical models.

Status
======

The parser is complete, and returns a parse tree.

Most of the model evaluation functions are available.

The examples directory contains examples from the
OpenBUGS distribution, extracted from their archive
format into text files.

The examples/_py directory contains some of the models
which have been compiled by hand from BUGS to python,
using the model evaluation functions.  The automatic
compiler has not yet been written.
